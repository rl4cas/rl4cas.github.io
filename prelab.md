# Introduction

The lab uses torchRL and open AI gym. The training can be performed on CPU/GPU, however, it is best that the experiments is running on GPU. 
In order to streamline the setup process and focus on the environment construction and training we have AWS g5.xlarge instances for use and 
provide docker images to manage all the dependencies.

# Access the AWS g5.xlarge instance


# Launch the docker image


# Activate the conda environment


# Clone the code and start the training
