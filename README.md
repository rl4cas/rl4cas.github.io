# RL4CAS Tutorial Lab

This is the index page of the lab session for the [RL4CAS tutorial](https://rl4cas.github.io), focusing on bring in the reinforcement learning to computer architecture and system research. 
The repo of the lab is listed [here](https://github.com/rl4cas/lab).

The lab is targeting using reinforcement learning to find cache-timing attacks in microprocessors. Instead of relying on human expert, we formulate it as a RL game. For more background information, please see [AutoCAT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FinwdpKCS9oY-3PX38oZ2j1gCjqglX2d/view?usp=share_link).

The lab is divided into four parts listed below. The first two parts we describe how to write an RL environment and how to launch the training of RL. In part three we setup the training code to actually launch a training. And In part four we have a small coding exercise to include new action in the environment. Please click on the link for detailed description of each part.
