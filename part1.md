## Part 1: The Gym Enviornment

We explain how the gym environment is constructed for reinforcement learning.

### Gym environment 

```gym``` is an standard interface developed by open AI, it is defined as a python class with three methods ```step()```, ```__init__()```, and ```reset()```. It has become a standard for RL research and many mainstream RL frameworks support gym environment. For more information please refer to (https://www.gymlibrary.dev)[https://www.gymlibrary.dev].

### Cache Simulator Interface

The main focus of the environment used is a cache simulator, which forms the backbone of the cache timing attaks. The cache simulator implements the basic functions that are representative of a real-world cache. These include

```init()```, ```read()```, ```write()```, ```flush()``` and ```parse_address()```, these functions are defined accordingly.

```init()```: instantiate and initialize the cache simulator class

```read()```: perform a reading operation through the cache interface

```write()```: perform a write operation through the cache interface

```flush()```: flush a specific address from the cache hierachy

```parse_address()```: Parse the address into block, tag, offset

### Learn to play the guessing game

The cache guessing game is played as the following. First the attacker makes a sequence of memory access and observe the access latency, after acquiring enough information (decided by the player/agent itself, it tries to guess the secret )
Victim read data from an unknown secret address
Attacker make memory accesses (read/write/flush) 


Objective 
Attackerâ€™s guess correct rate
