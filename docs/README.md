# Tutorial: (RL4CAS) Reinforcement Learning for Computer Architecture and Systems Research

## Abstract
Reinforcement learning has been demonstrated as a powerful and promising tool in many scientific and gaming problems. Recently, RL has shown promising results to solve problems in the area of computer architecture and compiler. Nevertheless, the lack of an easily accessible reinforcement learning framework and tutorial has prevented its full potential in solving architectural, security, and optimization problems. 

In this tutorial, we aim to make RL accessible to computer architecture and system researchers, lowering the barrier for researchers to use RL in their own domain specific problems. The tutorial will be a combination of lectures/talks and hands-on labs. We will use our recent research artifacts as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of RL in computer architecture and system research.

First, we will give a general introduction on the foundations of RL, in which we explain the RL concept, the RL environment (gym), and a RL training framework. Then we will discuss the application of RL in computer systems. The first example is CompilerGym, which improves the performance of code using RL-curated compiler flags. The second example is AutoCAT, where the RL agent is used to explore the potential cache-timing attacks. We will provide the detailed RL formulation, the example code and a lab section to give the audience hands-on experience on how to solve a computer system problem using RL. Below is the tentative schedule for the tutorial.

The target audience include but not limited to computer architecture and systems (attending ISCA, and other conference attendees at FCRC) researchers who are interested in machine learning methods and their applications in architecture and systems, applied machine learning researchers who are exploring new applications of machine learning in domain-specific problems. Graduate and undergraduate students who are interested in computer systems and machine learning in general are especially suitable for this tutorial as the tutorial provides hands-on coding experience with RL.

This tutorial will create concrete examples and hands on experience to the audience on how to formulate a computer architecture and system problem as an RL problem, and run RL training. We hope the attendance will proactively use RL in their own research problems after the tutorial.

## This tutorial
The inaugural `RL4CAS` tutorial will be held at [ISCA 2023](https://www.iscaconf.org/isca2023/) in Orlando.
